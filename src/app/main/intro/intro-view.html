  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Pick your Premier League football dream team amongst an array of players and submit to the database to compare with teams submitted by other users.</p>

  <h2>App Development</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrates the following front-end technologies and techniques:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AngularJS</strong> fundamentals and best practices</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase</strong> for remote database purposes</li>
    <li>Implemented grid via <strong>Susy</strong> and <strong>Sass</strong></li>
    <li>Clean, modular, and scalable CSS via the <strong>SMACSS</strong> pattern</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please note that although the app has a responsive grid, adapting the presentation for small screens has <em>not</em> been prioritised.</p>
  <p><em>Supported Browsers: IE10+ and modern browsers.</em></p>
